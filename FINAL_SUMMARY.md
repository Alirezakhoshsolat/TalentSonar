# 🎉 TalentSonar - Smart Recruiting System

## ✅ **ALL SYSTEMS WORKING!**

Your AI-powered recruiting platform is now fully operational and deployed to Hugging Face Spaces.

---

## 🚀 Live Deployment

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alirezakhs/TalentSonar

**Status:** ✅ Successfully deployed and running

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Wrong API Method Names ❌ → ✅
**Before:**
```python
scraper.search_users_by_skill(query, limit=5)  # Method doesn't exist!

```python
scraper.search_users(query, max_results=5)  # Correct TalentSonar API
```

### Issue #2: Incomplete GitHub Integration ❌ → ✅
**Before:** Only searched for users, didn't analyze their profiles

**After:** Full integration with:
- GitHub user search with smart queries
- Complete profile analysis for each candidate
- Language and technology extraction
- Portfolio project discovery
- Statistics gathering (stars, repos, contributions)

### Issue #3: Missing Dependencies ❌ → ✅
Added to `requirements.txt`:

## 🔬 TalentSonar Engine API

Your partner's core engine provides three main components:

### JobAnalyzer
```python
from talentsonar.src.job_analyzer import JobAnalyzer

analyzer = JobAnalyzer(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
result = analyzer.analyze_job_description(job_text)

# Returns: JobAnalysis with technical_skills, experience, soft_skills, etc.
```

### GitHubScraper
```python
from talentsonar.src.github_scraper import GitHubScraper

scraper = GitHubScraper(github_token=GITHUB_TOKEN)

# Search for users
users = scraper.search_users("language:python followers:>=10", max_results=10)

# Analyze a user
analysis = scraper.analyze_candidate_skills("username")

# Returns: Full profile with repos, languages, technologies, statistics
```

### TalentMatcher
```python
from talentsonar.src.talent_matcher import TalentMatcher

matcher = TalentMatcher()
score = matcher.match_candidate(candidate_analysis, job_analysis)

# Returns: Match score with breakdown
```

---

## 🎯 Key Integration Points

### Smart Query Generation
```python
# Extract top skills from job
tech_skills = ['Python', 'Django', 'AWS', 'Docker']

# Map to GitHub language filters
lang_map = {
    "python": "python", "django": "python",
    "javascript": "javascript", "react": "javascript"
}

# Build query
query = "language:python followers:>=10 repos:>=5"
```

### Candidate Profile Enrichment
```python
# Search GitHub
results = scraper.search_users(query, max_results=5)

# Analyze each candidate
for user in results:
    analysis = scraper.analyze_candidate_skills(user['username'])
    
    # Extract rich data
    languages = list(analysis.get('languages', {}).keys())
    technologies = analysis.get('technologies', [])
    repos = analysis.get('repositories', [])
```

## 🚦 Deployment Pipeline

**Automatic deployment on every push:**

1. You push code to GitHub (`git push origin main`)
2. Hugging Face detects the change
3. Builds new container with updated code
4. Deploys to https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alirezakhs/TalentSonar
5. Live in ~2-3 minutes

**Check deployment status:**
- Build logs: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alirezakhs/TalentSonar/logs

## 🧪 Local Development

### Run Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
copy .env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys

# Run Streamlit
streamlit run app.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
python test_integration.py

# Test specific module
python -c "from modules.smart_recruiter import SmartRecruiter; r = SmartRecruiter(); print('OK')"
```

---

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. **Advanced Matching**
Use `TalentMatcher.match_candidate()` for AI-powered matching instead of simple scoring

### 2. **Bulk Discovery**
Increase `max_candidates` to discover 20-50 candidates at once

### 3. **Filtering**
Add filters for:
- Location
- Experience level
- Specific technologies
- Contribution activity

### 4. **Caching**
Cache GitHub analyses to avoid re-scraping the same users

### 5. **Email Integration**
Send actual invitation emails to candidates

### 6. **Interview Scheduling**
Integrate with calendar APIs for scheduling
